### Approximation of trigonometry functions with Tensorflow ###

in this folder are the approximations for sinus, unit circle and torus

#### Prerequisites ###

to use this approximation you need:
tensorflow 2.0 or higher
python 3.5-3.7

### tips for using ###

the sin.py/unitCirce.py/torus.py files were needed if you want to modify
the neural network, you can change the parameter of the model and create
a new neural network

the sinReader.py/unitCirceReader.py/torusReader.py files were needed if
you want to look at the results, you can plot the approximation, show values
or show the differents between the real and approximation values

for more information about the details of the files please look at the report
